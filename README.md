## Setup

To use this app you need to 
[sign up](https://developer.transportapi.com/signup)
 for an app ID and app Key on TransportAPi's website.
 
 Once you have those create a `keys.plist` file in the root of the application directory
 and put two values into it.
 
 ```
 transportapi_app_id: <your app id>
 transportapi_app_key: <your app key>
 ```

See [NetworkManager.swift](Leave%20Now/Models/NetworkManager.swift) for usage of these keys.
